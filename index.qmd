I am Jean de Dieu Nyandwi. I work on machine learning and multimoda AI, and currently a visiting researcher at CMU LTI, where I am fortune to work with [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com/) and other amazing people in Neulab and CMU.

I recently completed MS Engineering AI at Carnegie Mellon University. I did undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at University of Rwanda, learning machine learning on the side. Prior to that, I achieved the top score, country wide, in Advanced Level National Examinations in Electronics and Telecommunication, senior highschool.

Beside research, I also have interests in AI education and accessibility, and I spend a fair amount of time [designing](https://nyandwi.com/machine_learning_complete/), exploring, and [sharing](https://twitter.com/Jeande_d) learning resources.

Outside technical works, I regularly workout, mostly resilience training, crossfit, calisthenics, basketball, and running.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning and multimodal AI. More specifically, I work on improving and evaluating vision language models.

## Publications


```{ojs}
publications = FileAttachment("pub.json").json()

// Function to format authors - handles both string and array
function formatAuthors(authors) {
  if (typeof authors === 'string') return authors;
  if (Array.isArray(authors)) return authors.join(", ");
  return "";
}

// Create the HTML for publications
html`<div class="pub-container">
  ${publications.publications.map(pub => {
    return `
      <div class="pub-card">
        <div class="pub-thumbnail">
          <img src="${pub.thumbnail}" alt="${pub.title} thumbnail">
        </div>
        <div class="pub-content">
          <div class="pub-header">
            <h2 class="pub-title">${pub.title}</h2>
            <span class="pub-year">${pub.year}</span>
          </div>
          <div class="pub-authors">
            ${formatAuthors(pub.authors)}
          </div>
          <div class="pub-venue">
            <strong>${pub.venue}</strong>, ${pub.date}
            ${pub.media ? `‚Ä¢ As seen on: <a href="${pub.media.url}" style="color: #0366d6;">${pub.media.name}</a>` : ''}
          </div>
          <div class="pub-links">
            ${pub.links.map(link => 
              `<a href="${link.url}" class="pub-link">${link.label}</a>`
            ).join('')}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    `
  }).join('')}
</div>`
