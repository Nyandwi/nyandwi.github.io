I am Jean de Dieu Nyandwi. I work on machine learning and multimodal AI and am currently a visiting researcher at CMU’s Language Technologies Institute (NeuLab), where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com/) and other amazing colleagues at [Neulab](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/) and across CMU. I have also had the privilege of collaborating with [Prof. Deva Ramanan](https://cs.cmu.edu/~deva).

I am broadly interested in machine learning, natural language processing, multimodal recognition, and data-centric approaches. I am currently interested in multimodal post-training, reasoning, and data curation/data-efficiency in VLMs.

I have previously worked on [natural adversarial evaluation in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669)(NaturalBench - NeurIPS 2024), [grounding multimodal LLMs with world knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07414)(EMNLP 2025), and open-source multilingual/cultural multimodal LLMs/datasets ([CulturalGround](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neulab/CulturalGround) - EMNLP 2025, [Pangea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16153) - ICLR 2024).

:::

I completed MS Engineering AI at Carnegie Mellon University. I did undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, learning machine learning on the side. Prior to that, I achieved the top score, country wide, in Advanced Level National Examinations in Electronics and Telecommunication in senior highschool.

Beside research, I also have interests in AI education and accessibility, and I spend a fair amount of time [designing](https://nyandwi.com/machine_learning_complete/), [writing](https://deeprevision.github.io/) [deep dives](https://deeprevision.github.io/posts/001-transformer/), exploring, and [sharing](https://twitter.com/Jeande_d) learning resources.

Outside technical works, I regularly workout, mostly resilience training, crossfit, calisthenics, basketball, and running.

**Note: I am applying for PhD (Fall 2026). Please contact me at jeandedi@andrew.cmu.edu for callaboration or chat!**

## Publications


```{ojs}
publications = FileAttachment("pub.json").json()

// Function to format authors - handles both string and array
function formatAuthors(authors) {
  if (typeof authors === 'string') return authors;
  if (Array.isArray(authors)) return authors.join(", ");
  return "";
}

// Create the HTML for publications
html`<div class="pub-container">
  ${publications.publications.map(pub => {
    return `
      <div class="pub-card">
        <div class="pub-thumbnail">
