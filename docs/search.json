    "text": "I have been yearning a lot about writing things that are not related to technical topics. There are times ideas sparks and either end up on social media status(which is not the right medium of sharing ideas, also hard to resist attention seeking that comes with it), my internal private notes, or simply life happens and I move on. And again and again.\nSo I am trying this new things where I write about whatever comes on my mind without the fear of judgment that comes with sharing one’s mind online. The vast majority of people follow me for technical things and I do not think anyone will see this(if you do, ping me on X and I will update this page).\nThe posts are really my notes or things I do want to read. They should be small and I am not going to spend a huge chunk of time on writing this as I have bigger topics on the other side. This really is to capture serendipitous moments while they are still alive. I have noticed that when I am happy, my mind subconsciously generates things. This is a place for those things. Low commitment, short, and one theme. Let’s gooo!!"

    "text": "I am Jean de Dieu Nyandwi. I work on machine learning and multimodal AI and am currently a visiting researcher at CMU’s Language Technologies Institute (NeuLab), where I am fortunate to work with Prof. Graham Neubig and other amazing colleagues at Neulab and across CMU. I have also had the privilege of collaborating with Prof. Deva Ramanan.\nI am broadly interested in machine learning, natural language processing, multimodal recognition, and data-centric approaches. I am currently interested in multimodal post-training, reasoning, and data curation/data-efficiency in VLMs.\nI have previously worked on natural adversarial evaluation in VLMs(NaturalBench - NeurIPS 2024), grounding multimodal LLMs with world knowledge(EMNLP 2025), and open-source multilingual/cultural multimodal LLMs/datasets (CulturalGround - EMNLP 2025, Pangea - ICLR 2024).\nI completed MS Engineering AI at Carnegie Mellon University. I did undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, learning machine learning on the side. Prior to that, I achieved the top score, country wide, in Advanced Level National Examinations in Electronics and Telecommunication in senior highschool.\nBeside research, I also have interests in AI education and accessibility, and I spend a fair amount of time designing, writing deep dives, exploring, and sharing learning resources.\nOutside technical works, I regularly workout, mostly resilience training, crossfit, calisthenics, basketball, and running.\nNote: I am applying for PhD (Fall 2026). Please contact me at jeandedi@andrew.cmu.edu for callaboration or chat!"

I previously conducted a number of teaching activities around machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and language models.\n\nTeaching Assistant\nI was teaching assistant at Carnegie Mellon University in Introduction to Machine Learning and Introduction to Deep Learning. In both courses, I assisted with creating assessments, helping students with understanding technical materials via recitations and office hours, managing course websites and updating contents. In Introduction to Machine Learning, I gave a student lecture on Multimodal LLMs(slides here), something that I have been working on recently.\n\n\nIntroduction to Deep Learning for NLP - Mbaza NLP\nI co-instructed two months-long course on Deep Learning for NLP at Digital Transformation Center Kigali in Colloboration with Mbaza NLP. The course covered a range of topics from deep learning architectures, handling language data, best practices and relevant practicals. Here are some of the course materials.\n\n\nDeep Learning Instructor - The Python Academy\nI designed and was the instructor for Deep Learning certification bootcamp at The PyThon Academy. The bootcamp covered deep learning fundamentals and techniques with applications in NLP and computer vision. The students gained valuable and practical experience and used the gained knowledge to pass TensorFlow Certification Program organized by Google.\n\n\nAI for Everyone on the Web\nI regularly create online learning resources around AI and machine learning. Complete Machine Learning Package and Transformer video & article are most popular examples, you can find other resources here.\nAI Education is something that I deeply care about and hope to make significant contributions in the field :-).\n\nPS: My first real job, on a contract basis, was teaching English, social sciences, and maths at a primary school. This was right after completing high school, during the gap year prior to starting college."
