I also have interests in AI education and accessibility, and I spend a fair amount of time designing, exploring, and sharing learning resources.\nI did undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at University of Rwanda, majoring in machine learning on the side. Prior to that, I achieved the top score, country wide, in Advanced Level National Examinations in Electronics and Telecommunication, senior highschool.\nBeside technical works, I regularly workout, mostly resilience training and calisthenics, some basketball, and walks sometime."

There are times ideas sparks and either end up on social media status(which is not the right medium of sharing ideas, also hard to resist attention seeking that comes with it), my internal private notes, or simply life happens and I move on. And again and again.\nSo I am trying this new things where I write about whatever comes on my mind without the fear of judgment that comes with sharing oneâ€™s mind online. The vast majority of people follow me for technical things and I do not think anyone will see this(if you do, ping me on X and I will update this page).\nThe posts are really my notes or things I do want to read. They should be small and I am not going to spend a huge chunk of time on writing this as I have bigger topics on the other side. This really is to capture serendipitous moments while they are still alive. I have noticed that when I am happy, my mind subconsciously generates things. This is a place for those things. Low commitment, short, and one theme. Letâ€™s gooo!!"

    "text": "I very much enjoy teaching and talking about topics and things that I work on. I previously conducted a number of teaching activities around machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and language models.\n\nTeaching Assistant\nI was teaching assistant at Carnegie Mellon University in Introduction to Machine Learning and Introduction to Deep Learning. In both courses, I assisted with creating assessments, helping students with understanding technical materials via recitations and office hours, managing course websites and updating contents. In Introduction to Machine Learning, I gave a student lecture on Multimodal LLMs(slides here), something that I have been working on recently.\n\n\nIntroduction to Deep Learning for NLP - Mbaza NLP\nI co-instructed two months-long course on Deep Learning for NLP at Digital Transformation Center Kigali in Colloboration with Mbaza NLP. The course covered a range of topics from deep learning architectures, handling language data, best practices and relevant practicals. Here are some of the course materials.\n\n\nDeep Learning Instructor - The Python Academy\nI designed and was the instructor for Deep Learning certification bootcamp at The PyThon Academy. The bootcamp covered deep learning fundamentals and techniques with applications in NLP and computer vision. The students gained valuable and practical experience and used the gained knowledge to pass TensorFlow Certification Program organized by Google.\n\n\nAI for Everyone on the Web\nI regularly create online learning resources around AI and machine learning. Complete Machine Learning Package and Transformer video & article are most popular examples, you can find other resources here.\nAI Education is something that I deeply care about and hope to make significant contributions in the field :-).\n\nPS: My first real job, on a contract basis, was teaching English, social sciences, and maths at a primary school. This was right after completing high school, during the gap year prior to starting college."
