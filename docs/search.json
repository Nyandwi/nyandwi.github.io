I have had a fortune to work with Prof. Graham Neubig and other amazing people at CMU, mostly working on evaluation and compositionality in visual language models. I also have interests in AI education and accessibility, and I spend a fair amount of time designing, exploring, and sharing learning resources.\nI did undergrad in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at University of Rwanda, majoring in machine learning on the side. Prior to that, I achieved the top score, country wide, in Advanced Level National Examinations in Electronics and Telecommunication, senior highschool.\nBeside technical works, I regularly workout, mostly resilience training and calisthenics, some basketball, and walks sometime."
