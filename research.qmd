I am broadly interested in machine learning, computer vision and multimodal models. My research interests are right at the intersection of visual recognition and language models. More specifically, I am interested in designing better evaluation techniques for visual language models/multimodal generative models, studying their robustness and improving their understanding on visual language tasks.
